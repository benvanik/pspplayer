# TODO #
The following are items on my TODO list. Just because something isn't on here doesn't mean I won't do it; I either forgot about it or it's probably under [WouldBeCool](WouldBeCool.md) (where I imply that I want you to do it :). See [KnownIssues](KnownIssues.md) for workarounds or other information regarding problems with the current code.

## Short-term ##
  * VFPU support in the Ultra CPU
  * Fix cleanup code so no need for a reset between runs (and it doesn't crash :)
  * Implement some kind of global vsync ticker - right now several places all do the same thing, and all of them are out of sync - not sure if this really matters
  * "New User Experience" - automatically pick the best plugins and set them up
  * [Debugger](Debugger.md)

## Long-term ##
  * Build a site/database of unimplemented BIOS routines and playable games
    * This is about half done - I had to do a project for a class and used this. The player can submit game information to the service and it will be displayed to users. Need to finish it up one day!
