#summary Code licensing and sharing guidelines

= Open Source License =
I've chosen to use the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 (LGPL 2.1) for this project, as I hate the standard GPL. You can find a copy of the license [wiki:LGPL locally], or on the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html GNU website].

== Reasoning ==
I feel the GPL is too restrictive and don't agree with some of the restrictions it imposes. The LGPL seems fair to both the original developers and those who wish to use the code without opening anyone up to legal harassment or tedious compliance tasks. If you don't like the LGPL and don't plan to abide by it, don't look at or use my code.

== License Location ==
The license is located in `trunk/` and under all project directories as License.txt. It is not in the header of every file as I find that annoying as hell. As per the instructions in the LGPL there is, however, a pointer to the file at the top of all source files.

== Before the License ==
Some of the older revisions did not contain the LGPL text, however they should be considered to be under the license as the site was not made public until they had been properly tagged (the original SVN repository came from my local machine, months before I had decided to release the code).
