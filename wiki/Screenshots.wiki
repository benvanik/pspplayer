= Screenshots and Movies =
Although the emulator is pretty advanced, it is also in its early stages. This means that the screenshots you see here aren't that pretty yet. Newer images are at the top because I expect them to be cooler.

=== 2008-03-28 - Debugger ===
In an attempt to revive the project a bit, I rewrote the debugger. It's now much, much nicer and works. Still a lot to do, but for basic debugging it's functional.

=== 2008-03-12 - Puyo Puyo Fever ===
It gets in game, but the drawing is wonky (only every 10th frame or so draws)

=== 2008-01-19 - Every Extend Extra ===
Besides a few rendering glitches, the game works great! This is the first 3D game working; I was getting worried that I'd only be doing 2D stuff :)

=== 2007-07-16 - A-train ===
Just a menu for now, and it looks horrible, but I'll figure that out :)

=== 2007-05-14 - Tales of Eternia ===
The menu is now complete, with fades and everything.

=== 2007-05-14 - Tales of Eternia ===
Fixed the texture alignment issues! (and the random sprites)

=== 2007-05-14 - Tales of Eternia in game! ===
Removed one assert and now the game goes past the menu :) Chat boxes don't show up, and of course the clamping issue remains, but things are working! woo!

=== 2007-05-14 - More Tales of Eternia Menu hotness ===
Now I actually show stuff. You can hit start and go to the menu, but then things crash if you try to do anything. Still need to fix the weird texture clamping issues.

=== 2007-05-11 - Tales of Eternia (Menu) ==
Got it to the menu... kind of. The scene animates in, but when I try to hit start it crashes.

=== 2007-05-11 - Tales of Eternia ==
Trying to find something else to work on; ToE is one of my favorite games so that's the next logical choice. Having some issues, but the logo shows up!

=== 2007-05-07 - Puzzle Bobble ===
First commercial game :)
There are a few things missing, like the guide lines while playing, but other than that it works! Speed is pretty good, but is being held back by some bad OpenGL code and probably some game-instructed waits that are taking too long. I actually listen when the game says 'pause for this amount of time' - maybe I should only wait for half the time requested or something. My CPU sits almost idle while playing.

=== 2007-05-07 - Trigonometry Wars ===
Fixed textures up and now trigwars runs. In fact, it runs REALLY well, and is fully playable. Cool!

=== 2007-03-24 - PSPTris (game) ===
Whoa! By some form of black magic, PSPTris now runs in game! Sometimes control input is missed, and there is a random flicker here or there but other than that the game runs PERFECTLY. I have two or three things to fix (the OSK doesn't work because it does something weird, and I need to implement clipping in the video driver), but after that I can say that it works! Well, classic and original modes do, anyway. The color mode runs really slow, and I'm not sure why.

=== 2007-03-17 - PSPTris (intro) ===
With a lot of fixes and some reworking, I was able to get PSPTris to run to the startup screen! It's not yet complete (background color thing is missing), but it runs fast (like 150-200FPS)!

=== 2007-02-27 - NeHe Lesson 6 ===
After a long break and a lot of work, I present to you !NeHe lesson 6. You can rotate the cube with the controller and it shows a texture (that was swizzled - tricky!). It may seem like there hasn't been much progress since the last update, however this screenshot shows the emulator running with the new Ultra CPU and OpenGL video driver, and running at an impressive 197 million instructions per second. That is faster than a real PSP can run!

=== 2006-07-31 - NeHe Lesson 1 mod ===
Here is PSP Player and a real PSP running the ported lesson 1 from [http://www.psp-programming.com/code/index.php?id=c:pspgu-neheport-lesson1 psp-programming.com].

=== 2006-07-30 - The first triangle ===
Here for posterity is the first thing, besides text, I ever got drawing. A pretty triangle. And a dot. {{{^_^}}}

=== 2006-07-10 - One of the first applications ===
The real first application was my own empty app, but this is one of the first interesting ones: the basic controller sample from the pspsdk. I'm actually controlling it with my Xbox 360 controller!
