	/// BlockType class
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The BlockType class represents a specific code/text element<br/>
	/// such as a string , comment or the code itself.<br/>
	/// <br/>
	/// a BlockType  can contain keywords , operators , scopes and child BlockTypes.<br/>
	/// <br/>
	/// <br/>
	/// For example , if we where to describe the language C#<br/>
	/// we would have the following blocks:<br/>
	/// <br/>
	/// Code block						- the BlockType containing all the keywords and operators.<br/>
	/// Singleline comment block		- a BlockType that starts on // terminates at the end of a line.<br/>
	/// Multiline comment block			- a BlockType that starts on /* can span multiple rows and terminates on */.<br/>
	/// String block					- a BlockType that starts on " terminates on " or at the end of a line.<br/>
	/// Char block						- a BlockType that starts on ' terminates on ' or at the end of a line.<br/>
	/// <br/>
	/// <b>CHILD BLOCKS:</b><br/>
	/// The code block would have all the other blocks as childblocks , since they can only appear inside the<br/>
	/// code block . A string can for example never exist inside a comment in C#.<br/>
	/// a BlockType can also have itself as a child block.<br/>
	/// For example , the C# Code block can have itself as a childblock and use the scope patterns "{" and "}"<br/>
	/// this way we can accomplish FOLDING since the parser will know where a new scope starts and ends.<br/>
	/// <br/>
	/// <b>SCOPES:</b><br/>
	/// Scopes describe what patterns starts and what patterns end a specific BlockType.<br/>
	/// For example , the C# Multiline Comment have the scope patterns /* and */<br/>
	/// <br/>
	/// <b>KEYWORDS:</b><br/>
	/// A Keyword is a pattern that can only exist between separator chars.<br/>
	/// For example the keyword "for" in c# is valid if it is contained in this string " for ("<br/>
	/// but it is not valid if the containing string is " MyFormat "<br/>
	/// <br/>
	/// <b>OPERATORS:</b><br/>
	/// Operators is the same thing as keywords but are valid even if there are no separator chars around it.<br/>
	/// In most cases operators are only one or two chars such as ":" or "->"<br/>
	/// operators in this context should not be mixed up with code operators such as "and" or "xor" in VB6<br/>
	/// in this context they are keywords.<br/>
