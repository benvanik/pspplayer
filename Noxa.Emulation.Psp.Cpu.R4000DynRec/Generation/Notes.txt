AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
For some reason interpreted jumps in to _main + 4, instead of _main
This skips an addiu on $sp, which I'd think would be needed
BUT if this instruction is not skipped, the whole thing breaks!


DynRec overview:
 foreach instruction i:
	t = gettype( i )
	generate( t, i )
