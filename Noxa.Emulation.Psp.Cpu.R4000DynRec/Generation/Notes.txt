AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
For some reason interpreted jumps in to _main + 4, instead of _main
This skips an addiu on $sp, which I'd think would be needed
BUT if this instruction is not skipped, the whole thing breaks!


DynRec overview:
 foreach instruction i:
	t = gettype( i )
	generate( t, i )

Optimization:
don't break blocks on branches, only on jumps
even jumps could be simulated in a way that would eliminate the
entire overhead of the system (have inlined instructions to fetch
the next code block, etc)

in pass 1, define labels and add to hash table in pc/label pairs
in pass 2, mark labels
