Currently goes in game and is playable - most issues are with graphics.
Game depends on lighting system, which is not yet implemented.

# Graphics Issues #

## Logos ##
  * Missing: pre 'loading' bit - doesn't show (either doesn't render or emu loads too fast)
  * Incorrect: fade in/out

## Intro screen ##
  * Incorrect: fades out wrong - flickers fullbright then to current fade value - maybe lighting?

## Tutorial ##
  * Missing: purple legs
  * Incorrect: fog is a little dark

## Game ##
  * Missing: background/foreground sphere (lighting issue)
