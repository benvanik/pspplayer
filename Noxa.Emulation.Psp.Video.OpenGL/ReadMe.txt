    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : Noxa.Emulation.Psp.Video.OpenGL Project Overview
========================================================================

A native OpenGL video plugin. This uses the new CPU/Video interface.

Some of the theory behind this code comes from ector's release of his
PSP emulator. He's a much better reverse-engineer than I, and has a lot
more experience, so his worked :)
Specifically, these areas benifitted from his code:
- CLUT texture loading
- Vertex size determination
Thanks a bunch, ector!
